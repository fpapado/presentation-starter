# mdx-deck

An example of a [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) that
builds and hosts on Now as a [static deployment](https://zeit.co/blog/dockerfile-static).

To deploy it, run:

```console
now
```

or turn on the [GitHub integration](https://zeit.co/github) to deploy
each PR automatically.

**Note:** `now.json` marks this deployment as `public` (open-source).
