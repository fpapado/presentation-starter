# Github Bots, Talks, and long-term Projects

# A story

# A story
In particular, a story of learning to make Github bots, using them for a hobby, and circling back to work.

# Chapter 1: A Bot

The potential for Bullshit

# Things I liked
- The logo was mega cute
- The docs were really good!
- The API was fit for purpose, in particular how it gets out of the way

And all three of these things, had a large impact on what I've done with it.

Steps important, not just an API wrapper. Pitfalls, warnings, best practices.

Can't wrap everything with an API at once.
Backfill with docs.

Docs PR

# The API
TODO: Insert code of Probot docs

---

I read through the guide, built a simple issue logger, called it a day...

(I had questions still)

---

# Chapter 2: Some Talks

# A week later...

I can build it!

# Making a bot v2

# Chapter 3: A long-term Project

# A month later...

# I have a day job (truly)

# The FIBA team

One of the things I have built, where I can trace a line between ideas

---
There has to be a way to compose better
Announce elsewhere?
Keys?
---

Bothered me
Fri -> Sat
---

I lost sleep

---

Sat: realisation

Fotis' bs test for composition:

If this were Open Source, would extending it be a PR?

(Open-closed but for working with people)

---

Sat: another realisation
Middle ground inspired by Probot itself
Docs to DIY those parts!
More pleasurable and efficient

---

Glitch, env vars, inspect source "full-stack"

---

TODO: result

:blush: :blush: :blush:

---

Side-effect of docs:
Did not want to go back and change it.


--- 

Technology cloud

---

How to distribute among teams
Simple to install
Configurable
Bot-of-bots
Simple to add a new one
    (shouldn't have to write...)

(An Open Source mindset, if you will)

---

# Problem/Enabler: Make the thing, and make sure people can use the thing

---

# Enabler: Tech stack +- 2

---

TODO: list things here

Probot moves to TS -> we use TS!
PR on Probot -> Open/discuss PRs for the idea

---

# Docs-first
Picking up where I'd left

---

# Embarking on your own side-quest
Exploring in each direction, bring back things, leave as one-off, and maybe go horribly and the dragon will eat you.

---

Turns out, formulating a bit differently gave me motivation.
In terms of the project, a side quest :)

---

The result

---

Using:
Install one bot,
Config file

---

Creating:
Mostly-functional core, imperative shell
Safe core, unsafe world
(Mostly, because only validation is that)

---

Data structure
Action,
Validation

Be confident that if you add it, you only need to test your own stuff
Consistent reporting, as a team.

---

Find code at...
Open source soon?

---

To summarise:
- Try something
- Talk to people
- Remix ideas
- Document up-front
- Let things rest
- Go to step whatever
- Have fun
