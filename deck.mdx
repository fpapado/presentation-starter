# Github Bots, Talks, and long-term Projects

# The bots were us all along

# A story

# A story
In particular, a story of learning to make Github bots, using them for a hobby, exploring, and bringing things back.

# Chapter 1: A Bot

```notes
This page has everything I like on it.
```

---

# Things I liked
- The logo was mega cute
- The docs were really good!
- The API was fit for purpose, in particular how it gets out of the way

And all three of these things, had a large impact on what I've done with it.

```notes
Steps important, not just an API wrapper. Pitfalls, warnings, best practices.

Can't wrap everything with an API at once.
Backfill with docs.

Docs PR
```

I read through the guide, built a simple issue logger, called it a day...

(I had questions still)

# Making the bot

Github + Release event + Twitter

# Problems with composition

Some things bothered me:
- What if I want to announce on Slack?
- How do people set up the environment vars?

There has to be a way to compose better!

```notes
One of the things I have built, where I can trace a line between ideas
```

# Friday

I lost some sleep...

---

# Saturday: realisation

Tracing a line from Probot's focus on docs...

---

Fotis' bs composition test:

**"If this were Open Source, would extending it be a PR?"**

```notes
(Open-closed but for working with people)
```

---

# Another realisation

- Use docs to cover the DIY parts!
- I like writing; it is pleasant and efficient.

# Glitch: "full-stack inspect source"

```notes
Side-effect of docs:
Did not want to go back and change it.

# Chapter 3: A long-term Project

---

# Three months later...

---

# I have a day job (truly)

---

# The FIBA team

---

<img src="/assets/fiba_stack.png" />

Our glorious set of stacks

---

<img src="/assets/fiba_stack.png" />

Plus Github...

---

# Some Github stuff
- Heroku deploy previews
- PR monitor counter
- Build stats

---

# Where's the deployment button?
<img src="/assets/deploy_before.png" />

---

<Image src="/assets/hello_spaceship.gif" />

I can build it!

---

# Design goals
- How to distribute among teams
- Simple to install
- Configurable
- Bot-of-bots
- Simple to add a new one (only write and test what you need)

"What if this was Open Source?"

---

# Opportunities for learning
- Make the thing, and make sure people can use the thing
- Tech stack +- 2
- Data-first
- Documentation-driven

I could trace a clear line from the previous interactions to this one.

```notes
- Probot moved to TS, and we were using it! Validation
- Docs is where I had left things off, so I can pick it up again
- PR on probot to discuss

Turns out, formulating a bit differently gave me motivation.
In terms of the project, a side quest :)
```

---

# Embarking on your own side-quest

```notes
Exploring in each direction, bring back things, leave as one-off, and maybe go horribly and the dragon will eat you.
```

---

# The result: In action

<img src="/assets/deploy_after.png" />

---

# The result: Config

Let's look at configs from a repo!

---

# The result: Adding bots

- Safe core, unsafe world (Mostly, because only validation is that)
- Similar to what we do in other parts of the code, with some explorations.

```ts
interface Responder<Cfg extends {}> {
  /* Unique responder name */
  name: string;

  /* List of Github webhooks to respond to */
  webhooks: ValidWebhook[];

  /* The function to run after the webhook */
  respond: (config: Cfg) => (context: Context) => Promise<any>;

  /* The default config, merged with the runtime config */
  defaultConfig?: Partial<Cfg>;

  /* A validator that asserts that the runtime config matches the Config */
  validate?: ({}) => Either<any, Cfg>;
}
```

---

# Safe core, unsafe world

- Be confident that if you add a bot, you only need to test your own stuff
- Centralised reporting, automatically linked to our team's infra

# Summary: A guide to exploring
1. Try something
2. Talk to people
3. Remix ideas
4. Document what you can't automate
5. Document anyway :)
6. **Let yourself rest**
7. Tell someone about it
8. Go to step whatever
9. (Bonus) make a presentation
